# fxemoji
This repository aims to keep [Mozillaâ€™s fxemoji](https://github.com/mozilla/fxemoji) updated. Originally [designed by Sabrina Smelko](http://sabrinasmelko.com/portfolio-item/emojis/), they seem unmainted since Firefox OS for phones ended development.

## Goals
* Develop Fitzpatrick skin colours for affected emojis
* Design missing emojis to get full Unicode 9 support
* Create gender variants to concerned emojis
* Export working colour font(s)
